// jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. Its primary purpose is to simplify client-side scripting of HTML, 
// making tasks like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax interactions much simpler.

// In JS for selecting Something we use 
document.querySelector("h1");

// But in jQuery we just write 
jQuery("h1");

// And for more short 
$("h1");
