What is it that makes an API monetizable?
Depends upon these 3 factors:
1. Data collection - Have a large and valuable data collection.
2. Algorithm/Service - Propritary algorithm or a really useful service.
3. Simplified Interface -  A Simplified API for people to be able to work with something else.

What is an Internal API/ Private API?
API that is used exclusively within a single organisation, and by its internal development teams.

What makes an API RESTful?
1. It uses standard HTTP methods (Get, post, put, patch, delete).
2. Should have a standard data format that it responds with JSON output.
3. Clients and servers in RESTful APIs are completely separate, they are not in the same system or in the same file
and they're able to message each other over a network in order to make requests and also to get back responses.
(this helps in scaling each side independently).
4. Stateless - means that each request from the client to the server should contain all the information that's needed to
understand and process the request.
5. Resource based - Uses a unique resource identifier, also known as a Resource locator.

The Internet (World wide web) is considered as one of the most successful implementations of RESTful architecture.
